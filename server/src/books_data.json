    "title": "Ginger The Giraffe",
    "text": "Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Ginger. Ginger lived in Kenya, a country in Africa. Like all giraffes, Ginger had a long neck and long legs. Because she was so tall, she was able to eat food from the very tops of the trees in the savannah.  The savannah in Africa is an area with lots of grass and some trees. Sometimes, a savannah is called grasslands. The other animals like zebras and antelopes could not reach where Ginger could reach.  But Ginger always found food.  She loved the leaves and the new buds of the trees. One day, Ginger was busy eating her favorite leaves along with some other giraffes. It was a bright sunny day and there was not a cloud in the sky. It had not rained for a long time, so the grass was very dry. She heard a noise down at the bottom of her extra long legs: it was her friend, Mickey the Monkey. Mickey was trying to say something, but Ginger couldnt understand what he was saying. He looked very tired. Whats wrong? asked Ginger. Ginger was a very kind giraffe and wanted to help everyone. Just then Mickey fell over! Ginger was also a smart giraffe. She knew what was wrong. Mickey couldnt find anything to eat and he was very hungry. Ginger nibbled some fresh, tender leaves and buds from the top of the tree where she was eating. She dropped some of the leaves and buds to the ground near where Mickey was. Then she nudged him a little with the hoof at the bottom of one of her very long legs. Wake up, Mickey! said Ginger.Ive found something for you to eat. Slowly Mickey sat up and ate a little. After a while, when Mickey was feeling better, Ginger asked him, “Whats happened, Mickey? Why are you so hungry? Why cant you find anything to eat?” Mickey said, “It hasnt rained for so long and now theres no more food.” “Thats not good,” said Ginger. “Whats happening with the other animals?” “No one knows what to do,” answered Mickey. “All the zebras and the antelopes and the elephants are getting worried about the dry grass. Some of them are thinking about leaving the savannah and trying to reach the jungle. Thats a long trip, said Ginger.Are you going to go with them? “I dont know,” answered Mickey. “What do you think we should do?” Ginger thought for a while and then suddenly, she had a good idea. “We should go talk to Leo the Lion. He is the smartest animal in the savannah!” Mickey was too tired to walk, so Ginger invited him to ride on her back. “Hold on tight to my neck,” said Ginger. “Theres a lot to hold on to,” joked Mickey. Ginger laughed. “Youre right. Ive got the longest neck in Africa!” So they started their journey across to the other side of the savannah to look for Leo. Ginger and Mickey were in luck!  Leo was sitting up on a rock and he was really easy to see as they walked through the grass.  “Hi, Leo!” they both shouted.  Leo had been napping and was a little grumpy when they woke him up.  But he was polite and said, “Hello Ginger and Mickey.  Why did you walk the whole way across the savannah?  Just to wake me up?”  But he was joking; he had a smile on his face.  “Mickey says that there is no food left on the savannah because its been so dry,” said Ginger.  “Do you have any ideas?” Leo thought for a while. He said, “Theres nothing we can do about the rain. It will come soon, but we cant be sure when it will arrive. When the rain comes, all the plants will grow again and there will be lots of food for everybody.”He thought a little longer. “The only thing I can think of is for everyone to move closer to the forest,” he continued. “There will be more things to eat there, but I know its a long trip and it will not be very easy. It might take days to get there.” Ginger and Mickey looked at each other and then looked back at Leo. “Thank you, Leo,” said Ginger. “Its probably best if they all try to get closer to the jungle.” They said goodbye and then walked back across the savannah.Now they needed to gather all of the animals together to start the long journey. Ginger didnt need to go along because she had plenty of food in her high trees. But she was a good friend and wanted to help as much as she could.They walked towards her favorite trees and guess what she and Mickey saw? All of the animals were already gathered there and waiting for Ginger and Mickey! “Why are you all here?” asked Ginger. “Eddie the Eagle told us that youre taking us to the edge of the jungle,” said one of the zebras. “How did he know?” asked Mickey. “He heard you talking with Leo,” said one of the antelopes. “So youve all decided to try to walk together to the jungle?” asked Ginger. “Yes,” they all answered. “If youll help us to get there,” added one of the elephants.“Of course, Ill help,” said Ginger. “Im your friend.” So they started on their big journey across the savannah to the jungle. The sun was so hot and there was no food and no place to get a drink of water. And then they heard it. It was thunder! “Thunder!” they all shouted. Thunder was very scary to the animals of the savannah. Can you guess why? Fire! Sometimes the lightning hits the dry grass and the whole savannah catches fire. Then everyone has to run. And that is exactly what happened. “Fire!” they shouted. They could smell it. And now they could see it. The fire was coming towards them! Ginger had to think fast. Because she was so tall she could see farther than any of the other animals.She stretched her long neck up as faras she could. Now she could see a place where there was no fire. “Quick!” she said. “Everyone run this way.”All of the animals followed herand ran as fast as they could. Soon, they wereout of danger. They stopped and gathered together one more time. “Is everyone here?” Ginger asked. She wanted to make sure they were all safe.All the animals looked around; they were all there. And then the most wonderful thing happened. “I felt a drop,” said a zebra. “Me too,” said an antelope. It was rain! Finally! Everyone was very happy. It started to rain a little more and then a little more. The rain put out the fire so they didnt have to run. And the rain filled their watering holes and made the plants grow again,so they didnt have to make that long trip to the edge of the jungle. Everyone would soon have enough food and water. So Ginger, the Giraffe went back to her favorite tree and continued to munch on the leaves and buds.",

    "text": "Everyone was excited to be going on the adventure that they had been talking about for weeks. Their teacher, Miss Squirrel, had promised a trip to remember and the whole class now skipped excitedly through the meadow. Well, nearly all of the class; alone at the back of the group waddled Hank. Hank was a hedgehog who found it difficult to make friends. He always felt like the outsider. The others in the class, especially Matilda Mouse, kept away from Hank because they thought him odd.Yes, Hank was not really looking forward to the day.The journey to the Shadow Woods was longer than expected because Mr. Moles tunnel train was broken. Indeed Mr. Mole was there waving them off before he got back to work. This just made Miss Squirrel happier though, as she could talk to the children about all the wonderful flowers that filled Sunny Meadow. There was color everywhere. It looked as if a rainbow had crashed into the field.However, at the edge of the meadow, not everyone was looking at the flowers…Soon though, the Shadow Woods were upon them and something that looked small from far away suddenly grew very large before them. Each member of the class gave a slow gulp-Matilda Mouse, Rachel Rabbit, Wendy Weasel and Ralph Racoon. The biggest gulp came from Hank. He was nervous enough before they got to the woods and didnt have a friend to hold on to.  Matilda pretended to be brave, however, and ran on ahead compelling her friends to join her.Miss Squirrel was not happy about that and so she shouted for Matilda to come back. Then off she chased after her. Soon the whole class followed and before they knew it, they were right in the middle of the woods. Now instead of bright sunshine, only shadows scattered before them.The class stopped, their little mouths open in awe and wonder. Miss Squirrel was still chasing Matilda though and did not notice that she had left the little ones behind. Rachel Rabbit, Wendy Weasel and Ralph Racoon all held paws as they looked around them. Three very small friends.And Hank.The only noise now in the woods was silence.Suddenly, everyone got a fright as behind them Matilda mouse jumped from behind a berry-bush and shouted “BOO!” as loudly as she could. After they all had stopped shaking, her friends laughed.All except Hank. “Silly Hank,” said Matilda.“You are just no fun!” However, before Hank could reply, another noise made everyone turn around. This time though there was no Boo! of surprise and no laughter afterwards because there before the class was a very large and very hungry snake. His magical eyes twinkling with delight as his tongue spiked forward. “Mmmm!! Lunchtime.” said the snake. It was at this point that the class realised that Miss Squirrel had not returned from chasing Matilda. The class was alone. Squeaks of fright squeezed out of the little animals mouths. Matilda and her friends all hugged each other fearing that this was the end.Suddenly though, Hank was scared no more. He found a way to save the class. He knew just what he had to do. “Quick everyone- down this hole.” he shouted as he pointed to a hole under a hanging chestnut Tree. The animals stared at him and then jumped down the hole. Hank followed only to be stopped by Matilda who looked very angry.“Hank, we are trapped now- you foolish hog.” But before she could add to her insult, Hank jumped up and flipped himself into a ball. Next, he rolled towards the mouth of the hole and blocked it with his pointy sharp spikes. There would be no lunch for the snake today! Later, back at school, Miss Squirrel was telling the head teacher, Mr Owl, about what had happened and how the snake had fled Hank’s pointy spikes. After the snake had slithered away, the class had quickly returned to school and each one had thanked their new friend Hank.Matilda gave him a big hug and apologised for what she had called him before. Hank was not odd, he was a hero and her new best friend. Hank, who was still unused to lots of attention, turned pink and popped into a ball as all his new friends cheered him.",

    "title": "The Tooth Fairies",
    "text": "Deep in the New Forest where no big people ever went there was a tiny little magical village called the Ordon Gardens. Here, three little tooth fairies named Incisor, Canine and Molar were busy at work in their factory. The three tooth fairies were all named after types of teeth. Incisor was tall and skinny with short pink hair, Canine was also tall with blue hair and Molar was the short, wise one with curly, silver locks. All day long the busy little fairies cleaned and shined the children’s milk teeth they had collected during the night. The milk teeth were used to make very useful things in the Ordon Gardens like roads in the village and furniture in the homes for the little fairies. One day Incisor realised that the teeth coming into the cleaning factory were not as strong as they used be. “Oh dear!” said Incisor “These teeth are fragile and brittle, with holes and black spots. They crumble as soon as I try to polish them with my cloth. Whatever are we to do?” “Yes.”said Canine “I know exactly what’s wrong, The children are beginning to eat far too many sweets and are not looking after their teeth at all.” “I know…we can fix it!” Said Molar the wise one. She sounded quite excited by her grand idea. The three fairies looked at each other and waited while Molar explained all. As usual, it was a fabulous idea. The three of them wasted no time at all and got to work straight away. That night, it was Canine’s turn to fly off and collect all the milk teeth from under the sleeping children’s pillow. Off she flew with a bag of coins, some white berry sandwiches for her lunch and a pack of cards which the three fairies had spent all afternoon preparing. It was such a treat to leave the forest and see the city skyline but it was a dangerous place for fairies. Canine had to make sure that the big people never saw her. She flew through the starry sky and saw the wonderful city fast asleep. Her first stop was a young boy named Junior. Earlier in the night Junior and his mum had placed his milk tooth under the pillow. Mummy tucked Junior into bed and told him all about the tooth fairy who would leave some money in exchange for his tooth. She gave him a goodnight kiss and left him to fall asleep. By the time Canine arrived, Junior was fast asleep. She flew in through the top window that was ajar and glided quickly down to Junior’s pillow. She perched beside him and braced herself in preparation for the task… “Heave……..” she lifted the pillow and wedged herself between the pillow and the bed. She quickly grabbed the tooth and tossed it over to her backpack. She placed two coins and the fairy’s special card in exchange under the pillow and flew off into the night sky to find more milk teeth. In the morning, as soon as Junior woke up, he rummaged under the pillow to see if the tooth fairy had left any money for him. He was thrilled to find the coins but looked blankly at the card he found in his hand. Mummy didn’t mention anything about a card…he wondered. Back in the village of Ordon Gardens, the fairies were very happy about the new information card they were giving to the children. Soon enough the milk teeth coming into the factory were strong and healthy again.",

    "text": "“Hi, I am Abe and I am a Service Dog. When I was a puppy, my owner told me I would be a Service Dog for a person who could not see. I didn’t know what that meant, but I knew it was something special. When I got a little older, I was sent away to school. My sister was sent to another school to learn how to help people with Autism. To be their friend and help them get around. One of my other brothers was sent to a special school so he could learn how to warn people that they were going to get sick before they did. One of my other brothers was sent to a special school so he could learn how to warn people that they were going to get sick before they did. School was hard. I had to learn many things just like you. I had to learn to stop and look before crossing the street. And learn what a red, yellow, and green directional light meant and what I should do. I was taught how to guide a person to go left, right, to step up and down, to stop, to move forward a little, to back up, and much more. I had to learn where I was and how to get back, even in strange areas. I had to learn how to behave in a restaurant and never, ever, beg for food. That was hard. I had to learn that I could be a plain old playful dog as long as my halter was off. But once it was on… I was working. I became the eyes of my master and their safety and how they got around was up to me. After a long time in school, I graduated and my trainer introduced me to BJ. The person who would become my master. We were both excited. We trained together for several weeks and became very good friends. She was really nice and we always spent fun-time together once she took my halter off. One day the trainer said we were ready and I was off to a new home with my master and friend. We shared many years together and had many wonderful experiences. We went shopping, visited friends, ate in fine restaurants, and traveled across the country. I took care of BJ. I knew when she didn’t feel right and could tell if she was happy or unhappy, sad, grumpy, or whatever. I would always try to make things better for her. BJ took care of me.She knew when I didn’t feel right and could tell if I were happy or unhappy, sad, grumpy, or whatever. She would always try to make things better for me. A long time has passed and now I can’t help my friend any more. BJ is off to school again and training with a new Service Dog. I will meet him tomorrow and help him understand his new master. Then I become like my other brothers and sisters. I become a good friend for people in a good family. You really couldn’t ask for more.",

    "title": "The Case of the Missing Smile",
    "text": "“Now this looks like a very interesting case,” Detective Peterson said aloud, as she reviewed the huge stack of reports on her desk.“I think I will handle this one myself.” After several minutes of searching through the official Tooth Fairy records, she found what she was looking for. A folder with the name‘Sophia Sue Simmons’. “Hmm,” Detective Peterson mumbled as she studied the file. As Detective Peterson read the report, she noted that Sophia Sue always smiled. From the time she got out of bed to the time she went back to bed, she smiled. In fact, Sophia Sue never seemed to stop smiling. Then, two days ago, Sophia Sue stopped smiling. “Why?”Detective Peterson wondered.“I must find out why and get Sophia Sue’s smile back,”she said to herself. She searched through the file but couldn’t find anything that could have caused Sophia Sue to stop smiling all of a sudden. Was she happy at home? The Smile-O-Meter indicated “yes.” Was she happy at school? The Smile-O-Meter indicated “yes.” Was she happy with her friends? The Smile-O-Meter indicated “yes.” Everything that Detective Peterson found indicated that Sophia Sue was happy and that she should be smiling. The Detective checked with the dentist and everything was fine. The Detective checked with Tooth Fairy Central. All of Sophia Sue’s baby teeth had fallen out, been collected as scheduled, and replaced with new, extremely pretty, permanent teeth. Detective Peterson checked everything but she couldn’t find anything that could cause Sophia Sue to stop smiling. There was only one choice left.Detective Peterson had to visit Sophia Sue and see what she could do. That night Detective Peterson flew down and visited Sophia Sue. Making sure that she didn’t wake Sophia Sue, she sprinkled magical Tooth Fairy sand into the air. “Sophia Sue.” Detective Peterson whispered. “What happened to your beautiful smile?You look so sad.” “I lost all my baby teeth,”she whispered. “Now the Tooth Fairy doesn’t have any reason to visit me.” “Oh! I understand,” Detective Peterson whispered between smiling lips. “The Tooth Fairy will always be in your heart so you can wipe that silly frown off your pretty face.”  As Detective Peterson flew away from Sophia Sue’s bedside, she saw the smile return - bigger and brighter than ever before.",

    "text": "Princess Aura always has the best birthday parties and this year friends from all over the galaxy were heading to her planet to enjoy the celebrations. Captain Fantastic and his wonder dog Winston had picked the perfect present for their inspiring friend. However, Captain Fantastic’s arch nemesis, the evil Doctor Zob was determined that there would be no birthday cake for the pair at the end of this trip. The Rocketship stood proudly on the launch pad ready for takeoff. Captain Fantastic had just finished loading Princess Aura’s awkwardly long birthday present. “That’s it, Winston.” he said patting his faithful dog. “Now I just need to go and return all this wrapping paper.”and he headed towards the hanger while untangling himself from all the super sticky tape he’dused to wrap up the gift. Winston gave a happy bark and off Captain Fantastic went into the space hanger. As Winston returned to the spaceship he thought he saw someone walking away from their Rocket Ship.He looked familiar; was that Doctor Zob? Later, in the ship all systems were go. Lights blinked, screens lit up and Captain Fantastic and Winston were strapped in ready to go. “5,4,3,2,1, Blast Off and away we go.” shouted Captain Fantastic, a big grin on his face whenever he headed back out into space. Today Winstononly gave a little whimper though; what was that Doctor Zobup to? On Doctor Zob’s great black ship however, there was only laughter, the kind only an evilgenius can produce; deep from the stomachand exploding from the mouth. “Good luck Captain Fantastic,enjoy your ride. “Not long now, Winston. Princes Aura’s planet is just around the next sun.” explained Captain Fantastic. Out of the window Winston stared at the golden planets, and the shining suns flying past as they hurtled through space.“WahWahWah”. The cool hum of the spaceship was suddenly thrown into chaos as the red warning light flashed and the ship suddenly and sharply turned around.“Oh no!” cried Captain Fantastic. “We’re going the wrong way”. Winston looked at the screen and saw where they were headed: “Oh no, indeed!”The yellow rocket ship was now headed towards the Crazy Comet Cluster, the zaniest place in space. Hundreds of blazing red comets swarmed around a golden Yellow sun and if a spaceship got too close, they would chase and churn it for hours upon hours. Winston barked and ran to the back of the ship. “Don’t worry, boy.” said Captain Fantastic. “It will be ok….I hope.” as he started pressing buttons and fighting with the spaceships steering wheel. Sweat broke out on his forehead and his eyes widened into two moons of panic. Winston was not really scared, however, he was searching for whatever the mischievous Doctor Zob had hidden on their ship. Winston knew that it was the only reason they were in trouble, but what was it? Watching from behind a small green moon was the shadowy spaceship of Doctor Zob. A big smile of satisfaction grew on his face as he watched the Captain’s ship head towards the Crazy Comet Cluster. Once again his evil laugh echoed around the gleaming cockpit of his ship.“Magnetic force, keep that rocket off course.”he whispered to himself. Winston knew they were almost out of time when he saw it; or rather he sniffed out the evil stench of where Doctor Zob had been. It was a small blinking box just underneath the main computer. That had to be it. Doctor Zob had made the yellow rocket go in the wrong direction using one of his mischief machines. Quick as a flash Winston snatched the box in his jaws and teetering along the lengthy birthday gift threw it to the Space Particle Accelerator Machine (SPAM for short).He then used his paws and sent the device back to Doctor Zob’s nearby ship. ‘Lets see how much he enjoys those crazy comets.’ thought Winston. Back on the bridge Captain Fantastic was still banging, twisting pushing and pressing everything he could, When suddenly the ship turned around and headed back to Princess Aura’s planet. Winston trotted in and gave a friendly happy bark. “I told you not to worry Winston; as I say ‘with the Captain around a solution is found.’” Winston gave a happy bark before picking up his favourite bone and settling back to enjoy the remainder of the journey. A short while later Captain Fantastic and Winston were getting hugs and high fives as Princess Aura opened up her birthday present. “Anti-Gravity skies! “Cool!” she said while up above some crazy comets were chasing a rather unhappy Doctor Zob.",
